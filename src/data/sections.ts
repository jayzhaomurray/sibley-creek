/*
 * Site sections — the top-level navigation and homepage tile content.
 *
 * OWNER: editorial-director owns slug / label / kicker / cadence /
 * headlineQuestion. writer + style-editor own blurb prose. Section accent
 * tokens are owned by art-director (declared in src/styles/tokens.css).
 *
 * Frontend reads this; do not bake section identity into nav markup.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   slug              - URL fragment under "/", lowercase, no spaces. ASCII only.
 *   label             - Short display label in the primary nav. EN-CA, title case.
 *   tileLabel         - The display name on the homepage tile header. Usually
 *                       the same as `label` but allowed to differ (e.g., Labour
 *                       drops the "and Demographics" tail in the tile header
 *                       to keep the row scannable).
 *   accentVar         - CSS variable name for the section accent. The tile and
 *                       any per-section chrome consume this token; the value
 *                       lives in tokens.css. Stored as the unwrapped name so
 *                       components can wrap it as `var(--...)` once.
 *   kicker            - One-line description for nav menus, sitemap, etc.
 *   headlineQuestion  - The section's load-bearing question, per
 *                       editorial/dashboard_purpose.md sec 4. Rendered as
 *                       the tile deck (serif italic, one line on desktop).
 *   cadence           - Short string for the "As of [date] . [cadence]" tile
 *                       footer line (per editorial/dashboard_purpose.md sec 6).
 *   prints            - 2-3 most load-bearing prints surfaced on the tile.
 *                       Placeholder values for v1; backend pipeline replaces
 *                       these at build time once the data layer lands.
 *   blurb             - The event note slot at the bottom of the tile.
 *                       `kind: "fresh"` -> accent kicker, full readability.
 *                       `kind: "last"`  -> ink-faint kicker, muted treatment.
 *                       `kind: "none"`  -> the slot is reserved but empty
 *                                          (no blurb has ever been written
 *                                          for this section). v1 should not
 *                                          ship this state — every section
 *                                          has at least a last note.
 *
 * NOTE on placeholder values: prints, blurbs, and deep dives below are
 * placeholders sourced from the art-director's R1 ASCII mockup. They will
 * be wired through the backend pipeline (prints) and the writer/
 * editorial-director (blurbs, deep-dive titles) in subsequent passes.
